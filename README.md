# test-cases

The json file contains collection with two requests made in Postman.

Once you import file to a Postman you should create environment with environment variable {{GeocodingAPIkey}}.

Use this https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key to generate {{GeocodingAPIkey}}.

Automated tests will be run by running collection.
